# RooBoard65-
The Housing plate models (front and back panels with/out logo) and the hex code for  Skippy's Custom PCs' RooBoard65. I created this repository to essentially create a backup archival hub for the Rooboard, to be able to replace and source, manufacture replacement components of said keyboard from sources not of Skippy's Custom PCs. I built this repository just so that in the future, if someone who has this keyboard may have damaged a component of it such as the face plate, they will be able to replace it.

Want a unique quality mechanical keyboard but don't want to assemble it yourself? Then get us to do it! We can customise the Carbon Skeleton and RooBoard65 to your selections and assemble it with switches installed ready for keycaps (not included).

The keyboard is constructed from genuine Toray T300 carbon fibre, outer layers are 3K twill surface (for Matt Black variant) and coloured fiberglass for coloured variants, both variants inner is T300 unidirectional carbon fibre 0/90deg layup with 8 layers total. This gives the keyboard exceptional rigidity while allowing an open design for better acoustics and still allowing a desirable amount of flex for a better typing experience.  As with all our products it comes with a 5 year replacement warranty covering you for defects during normal use. 

We have a purchasable extended warranty with accidental coverage for this product. Select the option below, and your purchase will be protected from drops, spills, accidents, everything but theft, lost items and misuse/abuse for 3 years. See the full details of our warranty program below.**
